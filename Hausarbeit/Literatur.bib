abstract="Zombie texts like World War Z (2006), Warm Bodies (2010), or The Girl with All the Gifts (2014) have all spawned popular film adaptations, but current filmic narratives still often reiterate the traditional us-versus-them dichotomy of the genre's classic incarnations. Zombie fictions, by comparison, offer more subtle possibilities to explore the zombie's posthuman characteristics in their narratives. This chapter focuses specifically on the meta-critical and theoretical aspects of zombie fictions, considering these texts in the light of critical posthumanism, narratology, and a number of theoretical attempts to come to terms with our current cultural fascination with zombies. It also offers a brief historical overview of zombie fictions, reading them as a reflection of the prevalence and cultural significance of horror narratives in twenty-first-century popular culture.",

These bifurcations show that although linear instability of disease-free equilibria may exist in a model, perturbations of model parameters may result in stability. Thus, we show that humans can survive a zombie outbreak.&lt;/p&#38;gt;}, number={2}, journal={Letters in Biomathematics}, author={Allen, Robert F. and Jens, Cassandra and Wendt, Theodore J.}, year={2014}, month={Jan.}, pages={173-180} }
